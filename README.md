### Rust
I'm finally diving into the world of low-level system languages and *I hereby confirm to be a Rustacean*. This repository is supposed to cover my understanding's of Rust and it's concepts. I'll try to keep it up to date and add new stuff as I learn it. If you want to learn Rust directly by looking at code. 
- **I've explained almost each line with comments.**
- **You can create a PR if you want to add something.**

### Installation
You can install Rust by following the instructions on the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Running the code
You can run the code by using the following command:
```bash
$ cargo build
$ cargo run --bin <name_of_the_binary>
```
> Note: This is a cargo workspace.

### What is Rust?
Rust is a systems programming language that runs **blazingly** fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. It is a language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software. (https://www.rust-lang.org/). Well, that's what they say. But It'll be more clear when i'll try to find out during my journey.

### Why Rust?
Ownership Architecture mainly. It's a unique concept and I'm excited to see how it works.
